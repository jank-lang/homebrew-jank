# Installation
> [!NOTE]
> Depending on what packages you have installed already, you're likely to get warnings about `brew link` not completing.
>
> It's up to you how you handle these, you can safely "overwrite" the files that jank installs. Homebrew keeps all the original files in `$(brew --repo)/Cellar` and just links them to the main `bin`, `etc`, `include` and `lib` folders after install.
>
> If you want to recover them later, you can do `brew link --overwrite --force <formula>`, optionally with `--dry-run` to see what will get wiped.

Currently, jank doesn't have a stable versioning scheme so the only
version will be 0.1. As such, if you want a new version you'll have to
reinstall the package.

If you get an error about `git-lfs` missing, you may have to run the
below:

```bash
git lfs install
sudo ln -s "$(which git-lfs)" "$(git --exec-path)/git-lfs"
```

You can either:

```bash
brew install jank-lang/jank/jank
```

To just install jank, or you can tap this repo using the below:

```bash
brew tap jank-lang/jank
```

And use brew as normal:

```bash
brew install jank
```

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "jank-lang/jank"
brew "jank"
```
